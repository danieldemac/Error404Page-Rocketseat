This is a simple HTML page designed for the "Challenge #27 - Error 404 Page" of Rocketseat Programming School. The objective of this challenge is to create a visually
appealing and user-friendly 404 error page.

## Challenge Description

The challenge consists of developing a web page that will be displayed when a user encounters a 404 error, indicating that the requested page was not found. The page should provide a visually appealing and informative message, guiding the user back to the main website or other relevant content.
